#### mung-3-29-scrape
This mung used a 3/29/2017 scrape of [this DHS site](https://apps.state.or.us/cf2/spd/facility_complaints/). It's used for all the other analyses in the story. 

## analysis

Names of the notebooks are self-explanatory. All but Washington Gardens use either complaints-3-29-scrape.csv or facilities-3-29-scrape.csv.
